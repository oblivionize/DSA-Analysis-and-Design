# DSA-Analysis-and-Design

    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
      I had to develop a code that could take an input file of courses in a specific format and their prerequisites and print them in alphabetical order. The code can also search by course and display their prerequisites. 
      
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
      To approach this problem I made sure to think about all the functions I would need and develop pseudocode for the project. After develop my pseudocode I bagan to work on the actual coding until I finished. Data structures are important to understand because they can impact your desicions when designing software. For example, you would want to choose the best data structure for the job so the code runs as efficiently as possible.
      
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
      The hardest part for me was designing the code beforehand. I tend to just code as I go without planning, but this leads to messy coding most of the time for me. To counter this I made sure to spend extra time really thinking about how I want to the code to work before I started coding. This helped a lot in the coding process which was relatively painless.
      
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
      I used to not plan ahead when designing code so I definitely will make room for that in the future. It is important to understand the entirety project before rushing into it.
      
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
      I always try to write code that is very modular so this hasn't impacted that since I try to keep good habits. I'm usually good about using functions and writing comments in the code so others can read it easier.
